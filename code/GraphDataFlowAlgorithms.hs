{-
    Computes the 'modulus' of the graph, which is the weighted number of tokens produced / consumed
    on any channel during a single graph iteration.
    The minimum requirement on the (unknown) edge weights is that the average production/consumption rate,
    when multiplied by the edge weight, is integral. Given the repetition vector (which gives the number of
    node firings that go in a single graph iteration), plus this requirement, we can thus calculate per
    node a number of tokens that is an integer multiple of all associated average rates.
